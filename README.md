Blockchain BootCamp
I would like to develop an application to help renewable energies projects looking for investment to receive crypto funding directly to their wallets.
More details coming soon.

Workflow
- User will search through the different projects that require investment
- Projects will be rated and should be "verified" by an external audit institution who will give the rating in the blockchain
- After user is find a project that he/she would like to invest he will provide tokens (AAVEE, ETher, Bitcoin, etc.) to the project wallet.
- A contract will be created where the user has some return or benefits from the investment
-
